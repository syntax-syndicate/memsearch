If `stop_hook_active` is true in the input JSON, do nothing (prevents infinite loops).\n2. Run the transcript parser script to get a concise, pre-truncated summary of the conversation:\n   bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/parse-transcript.sh <transcript_path>\n   This script handles long transcripts automatically — it truncates long messages to the last 500 chars, reduces tool calls to one-line summaries, and only processes the last 200 lines.\n3. Read the script output. If it says \"(empty transcript)\" or errors, do nothing.\n4. Analyze the parsed output: identify what was discussed, what decisions were made, what code was written or modified, and any important outcomes.\n5. Write a concise summary (3-8 bullet points) of the session.\n6. Determine today's date and current time. Create the directory `.memsearch/memory/` if it doesn't exist.\n7. Append the summary to `.memsearch/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (using today's date) formatted as:\n   ## Session HH:MM\n   - bullet point 1\n   - bullet point 2\n   ...\n8. After writing, run: memsearch index .memsearch/memory/\n   If memsearch is not found, try: uv run memsearch index .memsearch/memory/\n   If that also fails, skip indexing (the summary file is still saved).\n\nIMPORTANT: Keep your work fast — you have a 60-second timeout.\n\n$ARGUMENTS",
